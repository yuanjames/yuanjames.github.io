I am a Research Fellow (Postdoctoral Researcher) in the <a href="https://bioml.eu.org/">BCML Lab</a>, School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, working with Prof. Wei Pang. I completed my Ph.D. at Heriot-Watt University in 2024, after beginning my doctoral studies at the University of Aberdeen (2018-2019). I hold an MSc in Big Data and High-Performance Computing from the University of Liverpool (2017). My research interests include agentic AI; multi-agent systems; graph neural networks; AutoML; inter/multi-disciplinary AI. I also have experience in entrepreneurship, applying AI techniques to solve real-world problems.
