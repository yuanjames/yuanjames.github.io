I am a Research Fellow in the School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at Heriot-Watt University, working with Dr. Wei Pang. I completed my Ph.D. at Heriot-Watt University in 2023, after beginning my doctoral studies at the University of Aberdeen (2018-2019). I hold an MSc in Big Data and High-Performance Computing from the University of Liverpool (2017). My research focuses on AI4Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, particularly in the areas of Graph Neural Networks and AutoML. I also have experience in applying AI techniques to real-world problems through entrepreneurship.
