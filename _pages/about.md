I am a Research Fellow (<a href="https://bioml.eu.org/">BCML Lab</a>) in the School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at Heriot-Watt University, working with Prof. Wei Pang. I completed my Ph.D. at Heriot-Watt University in 2023, after beginning my doctoral studies at the University of Aberdeen (2018-2019). I hold an MSc in Big Data and High-Performance Computing from the University of Liverpool (2017). My research interests include inter/multi-disciplinary AI, agentic AI, and deep learning, with a particular focus on graph neural networks. I also have experience in entrepreneurship, applying AI techniques to solve real-world problems.
